    - gosimple # specializes in simplifying a code
    - govet # reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign # detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
    - staticcheck # is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
    - typecheck # like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unused # checks for unused constants, variables, functions and types
    - asasalint # checks for pass []any as any in variadic func(...any)

    - durationcheck # checks for two durations multiplied together
    - errname # checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error
    - errorlint # finds code that will cause problems with the error wrapping scheme introduced in Go 1.13

    - goimports # in addition to fixing imports, goimports also formats your code in the same style as gofmt
    - gomodguard # allow and block lists linter for direct Go module dependencies. This is different from depguard where there are different block types for example version constraints and module recommendations
    - goprintffuncname # checks that printf-like functions are named with f at the end
