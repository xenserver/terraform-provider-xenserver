# xenserver_pif (Data Source)

Provides information about a physical network interface (PIF) of XenServer

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "xenserver_pif" "pif" {
  device     = "eth0"
  management = true
}

output "pif_data_out" {
  value = data.xenserver_pif.pif.data_items
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `device` (String) The machine-readable name of the physical interface (PIF) (e.g. eth0)
- `management` (Boolean) Indicates whether the control software is listening for connections on this physical interface
- `network` (String) The UUID of the virtual network to which this PIF is connected

### Read-Only

- `data_items` (Attributes List) The return items of physical network interfaces (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data_items))

<a id="nestedatt--data_items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `data_items`

Read-Only:

- `bond_master_of` (List of String) Indicates this PIF represents the results of a bond
- `bond_slave_of` (String) Indicates which bond this interface is part of
- `capabilities` (List of String) Additional capabilities on the interface.
- `currently_attached` (Boolean) True if this interface is online
- `device` (String) The machine-readable name of the physical interface (PIF) (e.g. eth0)
- `disallow_unplug` (Boolean) Prevent this PIF from being unplugged; set this to notify the management tool-stack that the PIF has a special use and should not be unplugged under any circumstances (e.g. because you're running storage traffic over it)
- `dns` (String) Comma separated list of the IP addresses of the DNS servers to use
- `gateway` (String) IP gateway
- `host` (String) The UUID of the physical machine to which this PIF is connected
- `igmp_snooping_status` (String) The IGMP snooping status of the corresponding network bridge
- `ip` (String) IP address
- `ip_configuration_mode` (String) Sets if and how this interface gets an IP address
- `ipv6` (List of String) IPv6 address
- `ipv6_configuration_mode` (String) Sets if and how this interface gets an IPv6 address
- `ipv6_gateway` (String) IPv6 gateway
- `mac` (String) Ethernet MAC address of the physical interface
- `managed` (Boolean) Indicates whether the interface is managed by xapi. If it is not, then xapi will not configure the interface, the commands PIF.plug/unplug/reconfigure_ip(v6) cannot be used, nor can the interface be bonded or have VLANs based on top through xapi.
- `management` (Boolean) Indicates whether the control software is listening for connections on this physical interface
- `mtu` (Number) MTU in octets
- `netmask` (String) IP netmask
- `network` (String) The UUID of the virtual network to which this PIF is connected
- `other_config` (Map of String) Additional configuration
- `pci` (String) Link to underlying PCI device
- `physical` (Boolean) True if this represents a physical network interface
- `primary_address_type` (String) Which protocol should define the primary address of this interface
- `properties` (Map of String) Additional configuration properties for the interface.
- `sriov_logical_pif_of` (List of String) Indicates which network_sriov this interface is logical of
- `sriov_physical_pif_of` (List of String) Indicates which network_sriov this interface is physical of
- `tunnel_access_pif_of` (List of String) Indicates to which tunnel this PIF gives access
- `tunnel_transport_pif_of` (List of String) Indicates to which tunnel this PIF provides transport
- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the storage repository
- `vlan` (Number) VLAN tag for all traffic passing through this interface
- `vlan_master_of` (String) Indicates which VLAN this interface receives untagged traffic from
- `vlan_slave_of` (List of String) Indicates which VLANs this interface transmits tagged traffic to
