# Terraform Provider for XenServer

**You can now create a VM on XenServer 8!**

## How to Build and Use

1. To compile the provider, clone this repository and run the following command from the repository root:
    ```bash
    go build
    ```
    This should create a binary called `terraform-provider-xenserver`.

2. Create the following directory in the user directory:
    ```bash
    .terraform.d/plugins/terraform.local/local/xenserver/0.3.1/<OS_ARCH>/
    ```
    The OS architecture will look something like `linux_amd64`. See [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/os-arch) for recommended combinations.

3. Move the `terraform-provider-xenserver` binary into the new directory and rename to `terraform-provider-xenserver_v0.3.1`.
    ```bash
    mv terraform-provider-xenserver \
    ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.local/local/xenserver/0.3.1/<OS_ARCH>/terraform-provider-xenserver_v0.3.1
    ```

This should now be recognised as a local provider by Terraform and can be set as a required provider in the following format:
```terraform
required_providers {
  xenserver = {
    source  = "terraform.local/local/xenserver"
    version = "0.3.1"
  }
}
```
